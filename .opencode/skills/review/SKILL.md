name: review
description: Review the current uncommitted tuiweather diff. Inspects git status + diff --stat to route reviewers — an inline correctness pass for any non-trivial change, plus `/security-review` whenever the diff touches an always-brake surface (user-config schema & migrations, secrets handling, release/publish plumbing, anything destructive or irreversible), and optionally a second-model angle on a meaty diff. Presents the reviewer plan before running. Does NOT change Status — review happens within status:in-progress. Use after /implement, before /done.

# /review — review the uncommitted tree

Goal: pick the right reviewers for what changed, run them, present consolidated findings.

**Shared rules in `.opencode/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** This skill is
the detailed expansion of §3 (Reviewers) and routes on §5's always-brake surfaces. The routing
table below is review's own, more-specific version of §3. **Review does not change Status** — the
story stays `status:in-progress` through review and patch.

## Workflow

1. **Check for a fast-path receipt** (§5). If `/implement`'s `## Verification receipt` is in
   context, recompute its diff fingerprint over the same file list. A match (and every gate in it
   still PASS) means the issue read and the file list already stand proven — skip straight to step
   2's routing with that instead of re-surveying. A stale fingerprint or no receipt: proceed
   normally below, without comment.
2. **Survey the diff.** `git status` + `git diff --stat`. If the diff is empty, say so and stop.
3. **Route reviewers.** Rows are **additive** — union the reviewers and run each once.

   | If the diff touches... | Run |
   | :- | :- |
   | Any non-trivial code change | the **inline correctness pass** — the orchestrator reviews the diff itself, across the angles a heavyweight reviewer would cover (logic, edges, error paths, contracts, invariants). Match depth to risk. Tests **alongside** prod code stay supporting cast — review the behavior change; the prod diff is the subject. |
   | **user-config schema & migrations** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **secrets handling** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **release/publish plumbing** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **anything destructive or irreversible** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | A **test-only** diff | the **test-quality lens** (below) — the tests *are* the deliverable. |
   | A meaty diff built by the default model | optionally a **second-model angle** (below). |
   | Docs only (`*.md`) and/or config, no application code | the **editorial lens** (below) — never "skipping review." |

   **`/code-review` is human-triggered, not a loop step.** The heavyweight multi-angle cloud review
   exists, but only Brandon can invoke it — no skill can run it, and a routing table that
   names it as the baseline just teaches the loop to skip that row. The loop's baseline is the
   inline pass + the second-model angle; when a diff is large or risky enough to deserve the
   heavyweight pass, *say so* in the findings ("worth a human `/code-review`") and leave the call
   to Brandon.

# Review routing

No reviewer agents exist yet — this table is the backlog. Until they're written, `/review` falls back to the general reviewer checking AGENTS.md hard rules.

| Path glob | Reviewer agent | Responsible for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/providers/**`, `test/providers/**` | provider-boundary (missing) | WMO codes and Open-Meteo response shapes never leak past `openmeteo/`; zod schemas match recorded fixtures; naive-local ISO strings become absolute instants exactly once, in normalize |
| `src/lib/weather/**`, `test/weather/**` | domain (missing) | metric-only storage/compute; display conversion only in `format.ts`; time series indexed by UTC instants + `utc_offset_seconds`; preceding-interval precipitation shift honored in `derive.ts` nowcast rules |
| `src/lib/config/**`, `test/config/**` | config (missing) | zod schema discipline; atomic tmp+rename writes; every `schema_version` bump ships a migration |
| `src/app/**`, `src/features/**`, `src/components/**`, `src/theme/**`, `src/viewport/**`, `test/ui/**`, `test/app/**`, `test/components/**`, `test/features/**` | TUI (missing) | breakpoint floors lg ≥96 / md 68–95 / sm 48–67 / xs 32–47 with clamp+ellipsis below 32; single-cell glyphs, no variation selectors or emoji presentation; ~100ms resize debounce kept; single-line strings narrower than their box |
| any `test/**` | test-fidelity (missing) | fixtures instead of network; injected fakes over real waits; golden diffs intentional |

Fallback: paths matching nothing get general review against the AGENTS.md hard rules.

   ### Second-model angle (cheap, orthogonal)

   A reviewer with a **different model than the implementer** shares fewer blind spots — a
   different prior catches what same-model review lets slide. Spawn a reviewer on the other tier
   for a meaty diff, alongside the inline pass. Prompt it for correctness bugs *and* anything that
   "feels off" — the different weighting is the point, so don't over-constrain it. It's cheap; run
   it freely on a substantial diff.

   ### Test-quality lens

   When the tests *are* the deliverable, review them as the subject, not as supporting cast:
   - **Coverage gaps** — which behaviors of the unit under test are still unasserted?
   - **Intent vs implementation** — does the test assert the *contract*, or merely restate what the
     code currently does? The second kind passes forever and catches nothing.
   - **Vacuous asserts** — assertions that cannot fail (a tautology, a threshold below the
     no-op baseline, an assert on a value the test itself just set).
   - **Brittle verbatim** — snapshots and exact-string matches that will break on an unrelated
     change and teach everyone to re-bless them without reading.
   - If a test appears to **codify a bug** — the behavior is wrong but the test enshrines it —
     **flag it as a finding**; never bless it because it passes.

   ### Editorial lens

   A docs/config-only diff gets read as an editor, not a code reviewer — light, but never skipped:
   - **Issue fidelity** — does the change actually satisfy the issue's `Acceptance:` line?
   - **Contradictory wording** — does it conflict with something else this doc/config already says?
   - **References** — do the section numbers, file paths, and links it points at still resolve?
   - **Formatting** — table alignment, heading levels, list markers consistent with the rest of the
     file?
   - **Unintended edits** — anything touched outside what `Touches:` (or the diff itself) named?

   No specialized reviewer, no automatic gate rerun — this lens is deliberately light because §4's
   gates already proved the deterministic part.

4. **Present the plan** (a status update, not a gate — §5):

   ```
   ## Review plan
   **Diff:** <N files, +<n>/-<m>>
   **Files:** <key files + scope>
   **Reviewers:** <those firing> — <why each>
   ```

5. **Run them immediately** in the same turn — no "Run them?" wait.
6. **Present consolidated findings,** each with severity (P0/P1/P2) + `file:line` + a **verbatim
   quote** of the offending line, then a recommendation:

   ```
   ### Recommendation
   - ✅ Clean → /done
   - ⚠️ Mechanical findings → /patch, then /done
   - ❌ Design-level findings → /implement #<n> with a fix-focused prompt
   - 🛑 A finding contradicts a project memory note → memory wins by default; surface it
   ```

7. **Suggest the next step** from the recommendation.

## Safety

- **A finding is a hypothesis with a citation, not a fact.** Before reporting one, read the cited
  line — grep the *assignment*, not just a textual match. Roughly one in three "X exists at line N"
  claims is a misread, and a confidently wrong finding costs more than a missed one.
- **Empty findings is a valid clean result; *missing* findings is a failure.** If a reviewer times
  out or errors, report that — never fabricate "clean" from an absent answer.

## Edge cases

- **Empty diff:** report; suggest `/next`. Don't run reviewers.
- **Fast-path receipt present but stale or missing a PASS** (§5): treat it as absent — survey and
  route normally, without flagging the mismatch as a finding.
- **Diff mixes story work + unrelated drift:** flag the drift; ask whether to revert before
  reviewing.
- **Finding contradicts a memory note** (an architecture rule, an invariant): the memory wins
  unless Brandon overrides; surface it prominently rather than silently dropping either one.
