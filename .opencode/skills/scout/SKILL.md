name: scout
description: Discovery-driven finder for tuiweather — fans out read-only agents across security · performance · hygiene · context · a11y lenses, verifies each finding against the real code, dedupes against open issues, and files the worth-keeping candidates as actionable issues. Read-only over code: it FINDS and FILES, it never fixes, branches, or merges. Usage `/scout` (all lenses, tightly capped) or `/scout <lens>` (one focused lens, higher cap).

# /scout — find tuiweather's next work, on demand

Goal: surface maintenance and hardening work the code itself is hiding — before it becomes an
incident — and land it in the same tracker every other skill already reads. Every other pipeline
skill *consumes* the queue (`/next` picks, `/cycle` builds); `/scout` *generates* candidates from
the code.

**Shared rules in `.opencode/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** Scout files
issues, so the filing mechanics are **§10** — dedup, the actionable bar, the body format, the
budget. Don't restate them; apply them. Also leans on §1 (Status), §2 (the `scout` provenance
stamp), §5 (a finding that touches an always-brake surface still gets filed, just clearly flagged),
and §7 (the batch-write rule).

**If `.opencode/skills/FILING.md` is not already in context, read it before presenting or filing
the slate.** It expands §10's filing procedure without displacing DOCTRINE's certainty and safety
authority.

## The cardinal rule: scout finds and files. It never fixes, branches, or merges.

The surfaces scout is best at spotting — user-config schema & migrations, secrets handling, release/publish plumbing, anything destructive or irreversible — are exactly §5's always-brake class.
Auto-merging a speculative fix there is how a real incident happens. Discovery is cheap and
reversible; a shipped-without-review "fix" isn't. Scout's job stops at a well-specified issue.

## Lenses

Run **all lenses in one capped sweep** by default; pass a lens name for a focused, deeper pass.

- **`security`** — the trust boundary, secrets handling, authn/authz surfaces, dependency CVEs.
- **`performance`** — payload weight, render/hydration cost, query and index patterns, polling
  cadence, work done that didn't need doing.
- **`hygiene`** — type-safety erosion (`any`, unchecked casts, `@ts-expect-error`, non-null `!`),
  dead code, and drift between near-duplicate modules.
- **`context`** — **does the map still match the territory?** Do `CLAUDE.md`, the docs, and inline
  comments still describe the code as it is? A stale claim here misleads the next cold reader
  worse than no claim at all. Every finding in this lens must name **both** the wrong inference a
  cold reader would draw **and** the concrete in-tree artifact that fixes it.
- **`a11y`** — semantic HTML, focus management, touch-target size, reduced-motion, and anything
  that encodes meaning in color alone.

# Scout lenses

What each lens looks for *here*, with the real smells.

## Boundary leaks
- WMO code literals (0, 51, 61, 71, 95…) or Open-Meteo field names (`temperature_2m`, `precipitation_probability`) anywhere outside `src/lib/providers/openmeteo/`.
- Any file under `src/lib/` importing from `app/`, `features/`, or `components/` — dependency direction is one-way.
- Provider response shapes reaching components instead of `CurrentObs` / `NormalizedForecast` from `lib/weather/types.ts`.

## Time semantics
- Forecast arrays indexed by position, or labels built from device-local `new Date()` instead of UTC instants + `utc_offset_seconds`.
- Nowcast reading bucket T as covering T→T+15; Open-Meteo precipitation sums cover T−15→T (preceding interval).
- Naive-local ISO strings compared as if absolute.

## Unit leaks
- Imperial conversion anywhere outside `lib/weather/format.ts`.
- Non-metric values stored in cache or store state.
- `°F` arithmetic in `features/` — display-only math belongs behind format.ts.

## Terminal alignment
- Emoji presentation or variation-selector glyphs (U+FE0F) — breaks single-cell alignment.
- Single-line strings exactly at container width: last glyph wraps onto a new row and shifts everything below (`seriesWidthFor` exists for this).
- Char grids built per slot (`cells[i] = "10a"` emits three chars for one slot) instead of writing `label[k]` into individual slots.
- `°` routed through ascii-font rendering — the tiny font lacks it.

## Test fidelity
- Network calls in tests — every HTTP response must be a recorded fixture under `test/fixtures/`.
- Goldens regenerated to force green rather than to record an intended visual change.
- Real timers/waits where injected fakes (fetchers, geocoders, timers) belong.

## The budget — quality over flood (load-bearing)

Within §10.6's budget: **all-lenses run** — ~2 findings per lens, single digits overall;
**single-lens run** — the top 3–5.

**Filing zero because a lens is clean is a success, not a failure** — say so and stop. A flood of
marginal issues is worse than a missed one: it burns trust in the whole queue.

## Broader threads are a handoff, not an implicit wider sweep

A verified finding can expose a shared pattern that may support distinct actionable issues across
other parts of the codebase. That is useful Scout output, but it is **not** permission to exceed
the current run's named lens or §10.6 filing budget.

Inspect only enough adjacent, representative evidence to establish that the thread is credible.
Cite what is confirmed, distinguish likely surfaces from verified ones, and stop before the
current pass turns into the broader investigation. Finish the original sweep and slate normally.

In the final report, add a **broader thread** handoff that includes:

- the shared pattern and the evidence that makes it credible;
- confirmed and likely affected surfaces, clearly distinguished;
- whether one issue is sufficient or several independent issues are warranted — one issue when
  the fix and acceptance are shared, several when the surfaces need independently shippable fixes
  or proof — plus the proposed split; and
- the focused follow-up `/scout <lens>` pass that would investigate and draft those issues.

Do **not** automatically broaden the current sweep, file speculative related issues, or create an
umbrella issue. The broader investigation and its filings begin only when that focused follow-up
is requested.

## Verify before filing (non-negotiable)

Every finding is a **hypothesis with a citation** until you've read the cited code. Open the file,
read the actual line, and confirm the claim — grep the *assignment*, not just a textual match. A
finding that turns out to be a misread costs more than the one you didn't file, because it teaches
Brandon to distrust the rest of the slate.

## File the fix already drafted (the fleshing-out rule)

A diagnosis-only issue hands Brandon homework; a drafted fix hands them a decision
(§10.3). Scout has already done the reading — it knows the file, the line, and what right looks
like — so the body carries that knowledge instead of describing where someone else might find
it. Every filed issue includes:

- **Evidence** — `file:line` plus a **verbatim quote** of the offending code, and, where one
  exists, the in-repo pattern that already does it right (the strongest possible spec: "make it
  match its sibling").
- **The failure scenario** — the concrete inputs/state → wrong outcome, and why it matters here.
- **The drafted fix** — the concrete change: a diff block, or the exact edit stated precisely
  enough to apply without re-deriving the analysis. The decision becomes *"ship this? y/n"*, and
  the eventual builder starts from the draft instead of from zero.
- **Acceptance** a gate or a look can actually verify.

A finding you can't draft a fix for usually isn't actionable enough to file — put it in the
report as an observation instead. The one exception: a genuine defect whose fix needs a design
call — file it with the options sketched and route it `status:needs-decision` (§10.5),
never pickable.

## Workflow

1. **Pick the lenses** (all, or the named one).
2. **Sweep, read-only.** Fan out across the lenses; each returns candidate findings with
   `file:line` citations.
3. **Verify each candidate against the real file.** Drop anything that doesn't survive.
4. **Dedup** (§10.1) — open *and* recently-closed issues. A closed-unfixed twin is a rejection
   with memory: report it, don't re-file it.
5. **Rank and cut to budget.**
6. **Present the slate** — each finding with its lens, `file:line`, the drafted issue body
   **including its drafted fix**, its §10.5 certainty call with one line of why, and whether it
   lands on a §5 brake. This is a §5 plan — shown for visibility, then acted on in the same turn;
   an unattended run's standing go folds it into the report.
7. **File** (§7): `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --label "scout"` per finding, then route each by
   its certainty call (§10.5) — deterministic → `gh issue edit "<n>" --remove-label "status:ready,status:in-progress,status:in-review,status:blocked,status:needs-decision" && gh issue edit "<n>" --add-label "status:ready"`,
   interpretive → `gh issue edit "<n>" --remove-label "status:ready,status:in-progress,status:in-review,status:blocked,status:needs-decision" && gh issue edit "<n>" --add-label "status:needs-decision"`, unsure → no status write —
   plus anything this repo's lens table adds. A plain loop is correct here; these are REST calls,
   and there is nothing to batch around. Tracker unreachable → say so and stop; don't pretend it
   filed.
8. **Report.** What was filed (links, labels, which ones flag a §5 brake for later), what was found
   but not filed (dups, below-the-cut, "clean on this lens"), any credible **broader thread**
   handoff from above, and point at `/next`.

## Guardrails

- **Find and file only — never fix, branch, or merge.** If it's tempting to "just fix this one,"
  file it instead and let `/cycle` do it with a human watching.
- **Verify every finding against the real file before it reaches the slate.** Non-negotiable.
- **Respect the budget.** Fewer, sharper issues beat a flood; zero is a fine outcome.
- **Dedup is not optional.**
- **Read-only until the step-6 slate is shown.** Presenting it is a §5 plan, not a "Proceed?"
  prompt — but nothing is created before it exists.
- **Always-brake findings still get filed** — just clearly labeled as needing `/security-review` at
  build time, never framed as a quick auto-mergeable patch.

## How it fits the pipeline

- **`/scout`** = code → candidate issues (the discovery front door).
- **`/next`** = ranks and picks. A scout-filed issue arrives already routed by §10.5's certainty
  call: deterministic findings are pickable on arrival, interpretive ones sit on Brandon's
  decision queue with the fix pre-drafted, and only the genuinely unsure land under **Untriaged**.
- **`/implement` / `/cycle`** = build a picked issue; §5 still brakes regardless of who filed it.
- **`/burndown`** = curates the believed-safe subset and loops `/cycle` over it.
