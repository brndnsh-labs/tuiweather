# Pipeline doctrine (shared)

Single source of truth for the rules the tuiweather work-loop skills share. A skill that says
"see DOCTRINE §X" means *this* file. **If this isn't already in your context, read it once** —
within a session the read amortizes across every pipeline skill you run.

Reconcile here, not in the skills: when a rule changes, edit this file, not the skills that
restate it. The skills hold only their *unique* procedure.

# Posture

Small, opinionated codebase where the gates do most of the reviewing — tight changes win.

Correctness invariants are product features: metric internally, absolute time everywhere, terminal alignment at every width. Violations are bugs, not style nits.

Dependencies stay minimal; every addition is a decision someone defends, not an accident that accumulates.

AGENTS.md records hard-won OpenTUI knowledge and is ground truth for UI work — when it and instinct disagree, it wins until verified otherwise.

## §1 Tracker & readiness

The tracker is **GitHub issues** (`brndnsh-labs/tuiweather`). A **story = an issue**: its **body** holds
Why / Touches / Acceptance; routing lives in its **labels** (§3). **Milestones = epics.**

**"The board" is the open issue list** — there is no separate artifact to keep in sync, and
nothing to be on or off. Status is one `status:*` label on the issue itself.

| Status label | Meaning | Pipeline action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status:ready` | scoped + pickable | `/next` ranks & picks; `/implement`/`/cycle` build |
| `status:in-progress` | being built | don't re-pick |
| `status:in-review` | built, under review / PR open | don't re-pick |
| `status:blocked` | blocked on a dependency | skip; name the blocker |
| `status:needs-decision` | blocked on a human call | surface it; **don't build** |
| *(none)* | the idea pile — filed but not scheduled | triage/scope it first; don't pick |

After a successful status transition, exactly one `status:*` label remains. The ordered write
clears the whole set before adding the target, so there is a brief unlabeled intermediate event
but never overlapping status values. Outside that in-flight transition, **no label is a real
state**, not a gap — it's every issue still waiting on a §10.5 certainty call (a review-carved
observation, §2; a finding the filer couldn't confidently route), and that untriaged pile is where
triage starts.

**Ranking pickable work** (`/next`): **milestone first** (a real numbered epic beats no milestone), then **issue number** (lower first).

**A closed issue is "done."** `Closes #<n>` closes the issue on merge, and that close *is* the
completion record — there is no `status:done`, because a second source of truth can disagree with
the close and will eventually go stale. Status labels route **open** issues only; the last one may
remain as the issue's final open-state history after closure, but the open-only board ignores it.
The pipeline writes `status:in-review` when the PR opens, then lets the merge finish the
story. Reopening starts a new routing decision: explicitly set the next status; never infer it
from the retained label.

**A stale-*open* issue may already be shipped.** An umbrella/parent issue's slices often ship
under sibling-numbered PRs that never reference the umbrella's own number — `git log --grep=#<n>`
finds nothing even though the work is done. Before building a pickable-looking issue, trace
whether the described *behavior* already exists in live code (`git log -S"<symbol>"`, read the
actual function) — don't trust issue-number absence in history as proof no work has happened.

# Tracker readiness

- No milestones in use yet — effective ranking falls back to issue number.
- A `status:ready` issue carries acceptance criteria or a repro inline; if the scoping lives only in a comment thread, finish scoping before flipping it ready.
- Titles follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) — the release script generates the changelog from merged titles verbatim.
- Bug reports name the terminal emulator and column width where relevant; rendering behavior is breakpoint-dependent.

## §2 Labels

- **`finding`** — review debt, diff-coupled; **should trend to empty**. A cycle must not *grow*
  this set as a side effect — escalate only with Brandon's nod (§5).
- **`scout`** — provenance stamp on issues filed by a `/scout` sweep, so their origin stays
  visible later. Additive only; doesn't change routing.

**An issue carved from a review's out-of-scope observation arrives unrouted by design** — no
routing values set. Don't treat that as under-specification: routing is decided by the *picking*
skill at `/cycle` time, from what the diff actually touches, not at filing time.

## §3 Routing

- **Model:** Use the active harness's default model unless the task explicitly requires another.
- **Executor:** **`orchestrator-inline` by default** — the main thread builds directly,
  keeping accumulated context. **Spawn parallel agents only for
  independent mechanical work** (the same change across several files); keep shared-file edits
  (indexes, schema) and the validation gates on the main thread.
- **Reviewer** (`/review` routes by the diff):
  - The **inline correctness pass** — any non-trivial diff. The orchestrator reviews the diff
    itself (logic, edges, error paths, contracts, invariants). The heavyweight `/code-review` is
    **human-triggered** — the loop cannot invoke it; offer it on a large or risky diff and leave
    the call to Brandon.
  - **`/security-review`** — **additionally**, whenever the diff touches user-config schema & migrations, secrets handling, release/publish plumbing, anything destructive or irreversible.
  - A **second-model angle** (a different model family or tier from the implementer) is a cheap
    way to catch same-prior blind spots on a meaty diff.

**Re-verify agent claims:** a spawned agent's "gates green / tests pass" is a *claim*. Re-run the
gates **yourself** before trusting it — a spawned "all green" has failed in a clean shell before.

## §4 Gates

Local, before handing to `/review` or `/done` (never proceed over a red gate):

```
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build
```

# Gates

What each gate is for, beyond the command:

- **typecheck** (`tsc --noEmit`, strict) — catches unit and time-semantics violations expressible in types. Non-null assertions require a proven-safe justification comment.
- **lint** (`biome check` = lint + format) — formatting drift fails CI outright; `bun run fmt` before pushing, don't fix on merge.
- **test** (`bun test`) — new behavior ships with tests; bug fixes ship with a regression test. No network: HTTP lives as fixtures under `test/fixtures/`. Goldens update only via `bun test -u` and are reviewed line by line — a `.snap` diff must be visually intentional.
- **build** (`bun run build`) — the shipped artifact must bundle standalone with `@opentui/core-*` external; CI runs it inside the same required `verify` job.

Repo rules around gates:

- All gates green **twice consecutively** before merge (flake guard — don't waive it).
- CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`: manifest changes must carry `bun.lock` updates in the same PR.

## §5 Judgment calls & autonomy

**Default: run the whole chain unattended** for self-contained, gate-verifiable, non-destructive
stories; Brandon reviews the *result*. **Tier does not gate autonomy** — it only picks the
executor's model. What gates a pause is a **judgment call**.

**Stop and surface — the always-brake set:**
- **user-config schema & migrations** — Brandon wants to *see* these even when the cycle could proceed.
- **secrets handling** — Brandon wants to *see* these even when the cycle could proceed.
- **release/publish plumbing** — Brandon wants to *see* these even when the cycle could proceed.
- **anything destructive or irreversible** — Brandon wants to *see* these even when the cycle could proceed.
- A review finding needs a **design decision**, is **P0**, or **contradicts a memory note**.
- An **implementation choice is genuinely ambiguous** with no obvious default — surface options +
  a recommendation, don't guess.
- **Gates/CI red**, an agent returned **Blocked**, or a spawned "green" that doesn't reproduce.

When the work is well-specified, run it. When in doubt about a *decision*, surface it.

**Findings get actioned, not parked:** `/patch` fix-now is the default (P0/P1/bounded-P2); too-big
= *escalate* to a `finding` issue with Brandon's nod, never a silent defer. An implementer's
own "out of scope, defer to follow-up" tag does **not** override this — if the deferred item would
falsify the story's stated `Acceptance:` criterion, it's in scope regardless of the tag.

**Plans are status updates, not confirmation gates.** Every pipeline skill presents its plan
(`## Plan` / `## Cycle plan` / `## Review plan` / `## Patch plan`) before acting — that's for
visibility, so Brandon can see and redirect. It is **not** a "Proceed?" prompt to wait on.
Present the plan, then continue in the same turn unless the plan *itself* surfaces a judgment call
from this section. This applies whether a skill is driven by `/cycle` or invoked directly.

**The autonomous safe set (`/burndown`).** The unattended grinders operate on the **negation of the
always-brake set**: an item is safe only if it is *none* of the classes above AND is
well-specified, small-to-medium, single-area, and **gate-verifiable** (provable by §4). When
unsure, **exclude and surface** — a mis-graded autonomous merge costs trust; a skipped-safe item
only costs throughput.

**The fast path (`/implement` → `/review` → `/done`).** Ceremony should scale with risk, not apply
uniformly. A story is fast-path eligible only when it is **all** of: touches **one or two files**,
every one of them **docs and/or config** (no application/library code), the change is
**deterministic** — the diff would be the same no matter who wrote it — and §4's gates can **prove**
it, and it is **none** of the always-brake classes above. When unsure, it is **not** eligible; fall
back to the normal flow. A mis-graded fast path costs more than the ceremony it was meant to save.

On the fast path, `/implement` fetches the issue once, states a **one-sentence plan** in place of
the full `## Plan` block, skips task-list/subagent ceremony, makes the edit, runs §4's gates, and
emits a **verification receipt** instead of a separate narrative report:

```
## Verification receipt
**Issue:** #<n>
**Files:** <changed files, exhaustive>
**Diff fingerprint:** <first 12 hex chars of sha256(`git diff -- <files>`)>
**Gates:**
- `bun run typecheck` — <PASS/FAIL>
- `bun run lint` — <PASS/FAIL>
- `bun run test` — <PASS/FAIL>
- `bun run build` — <PASS/FAIL>
```

`/review` and `/done` may **consume** that receipt — skipping the reads and re-derivations it
already proves — but only while a **freshly recomputed** fingerprint over the same file list still
matches the one in the receipt and every gate in it reads PASS. A stale fingerprint (the tree
changed since), a missing receipt (a new session, or a normal-path `/implement`), or any gate
reading FAIL all mean the same thing: fall back to that skill's normal verification, silently and
without complaint — a receipt is an optimization a skill can always live without, never a
requirement it depends on.

The fast path still performs tracker status, branch policy, §4's gates, and normal delivery safety
in full; it compresses **ceremony and duplicate reads**, never the checks themselves. Each phase
still answers its own question — implement proves acceptance, review looks for what implement's own
proof can't see (missed defects, contradictory wording, unintended edits), patch resolves what
review finds, done handles delivery and freshness — the receipt lets a later phase skip *re-proving*
an earlier one's answer, not skip asking its own question.

# Judgment calls

- Golden diff you can't visually explain → stop. Never `-u` your way back to green.
- New dependency → stop and justify; additions require a case in the PR description.

What the §5 brake names mean here:

- **user-config schema & migrations** — a `schema_version` bump requires a migration; writes to `~/.config/tuiweather/config.toml` stay atomic (tmp + rename).
- **secrets handling** — keys resolve env var > config file and are never logged or embedded in error messages (reserved for future providers; Open-Meteo needs none today).
- **release/publish plumbing** — `scripts/release.sh`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, npm publish; public and effectively irreversible once tagged.

Also surface before building:

- Adding a weather provider or touching the WMO table → propose the normalize plan (fixtures, instant conversion) first; WMO codes may exist only under `src/lib/providers/<provider>/`.
- Changing breakpoint tiers or the glyph set → user-visible contract; flag it in the issue before building.

## §6 Merge guard

The pipeline pushes + opens PRs. **Auto-merge SAFE stories** (none of §5's always-brake classes,
AND green CI); **a judgment-call story's PR is left open for Brandon's manual merge** —
report "ready for your merge: <url>" + *why* it's gated.

**Server-side auto-merge is enabled here**, and the forge enforces the required checks — so queue
the merge and let it do the waiting:

```bash
gh pr merge "<pr>" --auto --squash
```

It cannot merge early: `--auto` waits until the repo's merge requirements are satisfied, and with
required status checks configured those requirements *are* the checks. Prefer this to a
client-side poll — enforcement survives a killed session, a crashed harness, or a denied background
command, and it costs no polling quota.

If it errors `Auto merge is not allowed for this repository`, the forge setting was turned off:
the declaration in `.cycle/config.jsonc` is now a lie. Re-enable it, or drop
`backend_overrides.auto_merge` and fall back to the poll guard. `cycle check --verify-forge`
catches that drift before it bites.

Closing rides on the PR body's `Closes #<n>` keyword — GitHub fires it anywhere in the body
regardless of surrounding prose (§8), so a multi-phase PR must never place that token next to an
issue number it shouldn't close.

**Reading a red gate.** Logs come from `gh run view "<run>" --log`.
`gh run view "<run>" --log-failed`
narrows one run to its failed steps, but it does **not** search backwards: list the runs first
(`gh run list`) and pass the id of the one that actually failed. A red CI is diagnosable, so **"retry and see" is not
an acceptable first move** — read the log, then decide transient-vs-real. §5 still makes an
unexplained red a hard stop.

After a safe merge: **sync local main** (`git checkout main && git fetch origin && git reset --hard
origin/main`) and prune the branch.

**The harness's own auto-mode classifier can independently deny the merge command**, even
on a safe story with everything above satisfied. That's an environment-level permission gate, not a
pipeline judgment call, and no skill text can route around it. If it fires: report the open,
CI-pending PR and ask Brandon for a one-turn approval to re-run the merge (or to
merge it himself). Don't treat the denial as a §5 pause, and don't retry with `--no-verify` or
other workarounds.

# Merge guard

Merging to `main` ships nothing. There is no continuous deployment.

1. Releases are cut manually by Brandon from clean synced `main`: `./scripts/release.sh <major|minor|patch>`.
2. The script runs the release gates, bumps `package.json`, prepends a changelog section generated from conventional commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and atomically pushes the release commit and tag.
3. The `release` workflow then prepares exact artifacts, publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publishing, and attaches standalone binaries + checksums to the GitHub release.

Agents never run `release.sh`, never push tags, never bump versions — see the release-path brake in §5. Deep reference: [docs/RELEASING.md](../../docs/RELEASING.md).

## §7 Tracker mechanics

Routing values are labels on the issue. `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,milestone,url` is the entire read path: it returns
`number`, `title`, `labels`, `milestone` and `url` for every open issue, and because it queries
issues directly it carries open/closed state intrinsically — there is nothing to intersect, and
no way for a stale row to linger.

- **Read the tracker:** `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,milestone,url` (one label: `gh issue list --state open --label "<label>" --json number,title,labels,milestone,url`)
- **Read one issue:** `gh issue view "<n>" --json number,title,state,url,labels,milestone,body`
- **Write a routing value:** `gh issue edit "<n>" --remove-label "status:ready,status:in-progress,status:in-review,status:blocked,status:needs-decision" && gh issue edit "<n>" --add-label "<status:label>"` — clears the status set,
  then sets this one in an explicitly ordered second call. Non-status labels: `gh issue edit "<n>" --add-label "<label>"` ·
  `gh issue edit "<n>" --remove-label "<label>"`
- **Bulk writes:** an ordinary loop, one call per issue. These are REST calls against the
  5,000/hr core pool, not GraphQL points, so there is nothing to batch around.
- **Issue/PR ops:** `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --label "<label>"` · `gh issue comment "<n>" --body "<text>"` ·
  `gh issue close "<n>"` · `gh pr create --head "<branch>" --base main --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`

A status label that doesn't exist in the repo makes `gh` **fail loudly** — that is the intended
behavior. Create the label rather than working around the error, and never invent a status value
that isn't in the §1 table.

**Confirm unreachable, then STOP.** A first transport or OS-permission failure can be the harness
sandbox rather than the tracker. When the error is compatible with a sandbox restriction and the
harness exposes a policy-supported escalation or approval path, retry the **exact same read once**
through that path — same target and arguments, with no weakened authentication or command. Stop if
that retry fails, `gh` is unauthenticated, the API rejects the authenticated request, or no allowed
escalation path exists. Never loop, guess tracker state, or substitute cached data.

## §8 Commit & PR conventions

- **Conventional Commit** (`feat(scope)` / `fix` / `docs` / `chore` / `test`), scoped to the area;
  body names the story. Include `Co-Authored-By` only when the active runtime explicitly supplies
  a truthful identity for this work. Otherwise omit it. Never infer an identity from repo config,
  the harness/product name, a model name, or a historical commit.
- **`git add <explicit paths>` — never `-A` / `.`**. Never `--no-verify`; never amend; never
  **force**-push.
- **PR:** base `main`, a "what shipped + which findings were actioned" narrative as the body,
  **with `Closes #<n>`** (closing the issue is the done-signal), title = the Conventional-Commit
  subject. PR bodies end with:
  ```
  🤖 Generated with [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)
  ```
- The `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N` keyword fires **anywhere** in the body regardless of surrounding
  prose — writing "Closes #844 is NOT set" still closes #844 — **except inside a code span or code
  block, which suppresses it entirely.** Never backtick the token when the close is wanted, and
  never leave it bare next to a number that shouldn't close. When carving one item out of a
  multi-item umbrella issue, never put that token next to the umbrella's number at all, not even to
  deny it — write "part of #844" instead.
- Post a one-line issue comment linking the PR; the narrative lives in the PR body.

## §9 Branch policy

- **Issue work → a feature branch + PR**, always. Never build on `main`; `/implement` branches
  (`git checkout -b <short-slug>`), reusing an epic branch if one exists.
- **Minor tooling / skills / docs edits → straight to `main`**, no branch/PR.
- **Branch off freshly-fetched `origin/main`, not local `main`.** A squash-merge PR is based
  against `origin/main` HEAD, not your local HEAD — if local `main` carries commits never pushed to
  origin, cutting a branch off it silently folds those unpushed commits into your feature's squash
  commit (content survives, but loses its own commit identity). `git checkout main && git fetch
  origin && git reset --hard origin/main` before branching avoids it; the tell after the fact is
  `git pull --ff-only` refusing to fast-forward with local-ahead commits that aren't yours.
- **Local branches don't clean up on their own.** The merge guard deletes the *remote* branch but
  never the local one, and they pile up silently across sessions. Periodically: `git fetch --prune
  origin`, confirm zero open PRs, then bulk `git branch -D` everything but `main` and the current
  branch (`-D` because a squash-merged branch is never a literal ancestor, so plain `-d` refuses
  every one) — safe, since the commits stay recoverable via reflog.

## §10 Filing an issue

Shared by `/scout` (machine-found) and `/intake` (human-described). Both *find or interview, then
file* — neither fixes, branches, or merges.

1. **Dedup first — and a rejection has memory.** Search open issues before filing; a
   near-duplicate gets a comment on the existing issue, not a new one. Then check recently
   *closed* issues too: a twin that was closed without shipping is a decision already made, and
   re-filing it because the code it cites still exists is how a recurring sweep turns the queue
   into a nag. Mention the match in the report; don't re-file it.
2. **The bar is *actionable*.** An issue nobody could pick up and start is noise. If it can't be
   stated as Why / Touches / Acceptance, it isn't ready to file — keep interviewing, or don't file.
3. **Shape it so the smallest human input unlocks it.** Prefer a pre-drafted fix with a
   yes/no decision over an open-ended question. A finding that arrives with the diff already
   written costs Brandon one glance; the same finding as a paragraph costs a work session.
4. **Body format:**
   ```
   **Why:** <the problem, and what's wrong today — with file:line evidence>
   **Touches:** <files / surfaces>
   **Fix (drafted):** <the concrete change — a diff, or the exact edit>
   **Acceptance:** <the observable condition that means it's done>
   ```
   The **Fix** line is mandatory for a machine-found finding (`/scout` read the code; the draft
   is the point) and best-effort for a human-described idea (`/intake` interviews toward it but
   files without it when the idea is scope, not a defect).
5. **Classify by kind, route by certainty.** Kind labels (`bug`, `area:*`, §2's stamps) record
   what you know — set them freely. The `status:*` label is a **certainty call**, made at filing
   time, with three outcomes:
   - **Deterministic** — the fix would be the same no matter who wrote it, and §4's gates can
     prove it → `status:ready`. That is real scheduling: an unattended grinder may
     build it (§5), so the bar is "this exact diff should ship," not "something here should change."
   - **Interpretive** — a judgment call anywhere in it, however small → `status:needs-decision`,
     **with the fix pre-drafted** (rule 3) so the decision costs one glance, not a work session.
   - **Unsure → no status label.** It lands in the untriaged pile (§1) for a human look — the
     filing-time twin of §5's "when unsure, exclude and surface."

   On a §5 brake surface, test the **direction of the change, not the surface it touches**. A
   finding there is deterministic only when it *tightens* — more validation, more redaction,
   stricter gates, fewer accepted inputs — **and** §4's gates can demonstrate both the tightening
   and that nothing legitimate was lost. Anything that loosens, exempts, widens, or re-opens is
   **never** deterministic, however small the diff: certainty and safety are different axes, and
   pickable requires both.

   The second half of that test is load-bearing, because tightening is not automatically safe. A
   redaction rule greedy enough to eat the evidence a validator needs, or a gate strict enough to
   reject legitimate traffic, fails *closed* — which is the quiet direction, and the one that
   hides. Pickable means the gates prove both halves; if they can only prove the tightening, it is
   interpretive.

   A brake entry describing an **irreversible action** rather than a code change — running a
   destructive verb, writing to production — has no direction to test and never becomes pickable.
6. **Budget.** Filing zero is a success. A sweep that files 20 low-grade issues has made the queue
   worse, not better. Cap a focused pass at **3–5** findings; a multi-lens sweep caps *per lens* and
   stays in single digits overall. Rank by (impact × how-actionable) and file only the top ones —
   mention the rest in the report without filing.
