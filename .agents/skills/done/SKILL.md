description: Ship a tuiweather story — commit the reviewed work, push, open a PR that Closes #<n>, and (for a safe story) queue server-side auto-merge; a judgment-call story's PR is left for Brandon's manual merge. Done = the issue closes on merge. Plan-first. Usage `/done #<n>`. Use after /review (+ /patch) pass clean.

# /done #<n> — ship a story

Goal: commit the reviewed work, push, open a PR that closes the issue, and land it —
queueing a safe story for CI-gated server-side auto-merge, or leaving a
judgment-call PR for Brandon.

**Shared rules in `.agents/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** This skill
leans on §4 Gates, §5 Judgment calls (the safe-vs-brake split; the fast path's receipt), §6 Merge
guard, §7 Tracker mechanics, §8 Commit & PR conventions, §9 Branch policy. The procedure below is
just the ordering.

**Done = the issue closes.** `Closes #<n>` closes it on merge (§1).

## Workflow

1. **Parse and read the issue ref(s)** — `#<n>`. Several only if one diff genuinely ships them
   together; usually one PR = one issue. Run `gh issue view "<n>" --json number,title,state,url,labels,milestone,body` for each and capture its title
   plus milestone/epic before choosing a branch.
2. **Confirm gates green** (§4) — never `/done` over a red build. If a fast-path verification
   receipt (§5) is in context, recompute its diff fingerprint over the same file list: a match,
   with every gate in it reading PASS, **stands as this confirmation** — don't re-run. A stale
   fingerprint, a missing receipt, or any gate reading FAIL: run them here as usual:
   ```
   bun run typecheck
   bun run lint
   bun run test
   bun run build
   ```
3. **Confirm findings were actioned, not parked** (§5) — `/patch` fixed every real finding, or
   each was an explicit escalation to a `finding` issue. Never a silent defer.
4. **Survey the diff** — `git status` + `git diff --stat`. Only expected files; flag drift.
5. **Branch check** (§9) — inspect `git status --short` and the current branch before staging.
   - If an existing epic branch applies, switch to and reuse it as `/implement` does. Otherwise,
     on a feature branch, continue.
   - On `main` with a reviewed uncommitted diff that has something to ship and no applicable epic
     branch, derive `<slug>` from the issue title, create `fix/<issue>-<slug>`, and continue
     (`git checkout -b fix/<issue>-<slug>`). If that branch name already exists, STOP for the
     naming collision — do not guess or build on `main`.
   - On `main` with no diff or nothing to ship, STOP. Never stage, commit, or otherwise build on
     `main`; branch before delivery work.
6. **Compose the narrative** — the "what shipped + which findings were actioned + why" summary
   that becomes the **PR body**.
7. **Commit** (§8) — Conventional Commit, explicit paths (never `-A` / `.`), HEREDOC body. Include
   `Co-Authored-By` only when the active runtime explicitly supplies a truthful identity for this
   work. Otherwise omit it. Never infer an identity from repo config, the harness/product name, a
   model name, or a historical commit.
8. **Push** — `git push -u origin <branch>`.
9. **Open the PR** (§8) — `gh pr create --head "<branch>" --base main --title "<title>" --body "<body>"` — base `main`, the
   narrative body, **`Closes #<n>`**, the attribution trailer at the end (§8), the
   Conventional-Commit subject as title.
10. **Mark it `status:in-review`** — the PR is now open, so its review-routing state is
    truthful: `gh issue edit "<n>" --remove-label "status:ready,status:in-progress,status:in-review,status:blocked,status:needs-decision" && gh issue edit "<n>" --add-label "status:in-review"`.
11. **Post a one-line issue comment** linking the PR: `gh issue comment "<n>" --body "<text>"`
12. **Land it — the auto-merge decision (§5 + §6):**
    - **Safe story** — none of §5's always-brake classes (user-config schema & migrations, secrets handling, release/publish plumbing, anything destructive or irreversible) → **queue the
      server-side merge** (§6). No polling, no background job: the forge holds it until the
      required checks pass.
      ```bash
      gh pr merge "<pr>" --auto --squash
      ```
      This returns immediately with the merge *queued*, so the PR is normally still open when
      you look — that is success, not a pending failure. Sync local main and prune on the next run
      that needs it, rather than waiting around for the merge to land.
    - **Judgment-call story** → **leave the PR open**, report "ready for your merge: <url>" + *why*
      it's gated. Do NOT auto-merge.
13. **Suggest next:** `/deploy-test`, `/next`, or `/cycle` continues.

## Edge cases

- **Gates red / tests skipped:** STOP — don't paper over it.
- **CI red on the PR:** do NOT merge; surface the failing job (§6 — read the log, don't "retry and
  see"); fix on the branch, push, re-check.
- **Unrelated drift in the diff:** surface it; stage selectively (§8 — never `-A`).
- **The merge command is denied by the harness's own classifier** (§6): report the open, CI-pending
  PR and ask Brandon for a one-turn approval. That's an environment gate, not a §5 pause —
  don't retry with workarounds.
- **Whole epic done:** note it; suggest a docs shipped note if warranted — don't auto-restructure.
- **Issue didn't close after merge** (a `Closes #<n>` typo, or a non-default base): close it
  explicitly — `gh issue close "<n>"`.

# Done — post-landing checklist

- User-facing surface changed (config keys, keymap, CLI flags, breakpoints)? → README / config docs updated in the same PR.
- `.snap` diffs present? → justified line by line in the PR body.
- Squashed commit title follows conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) — release.sh turns merged titles into changelog entries verbatim.

Nothing else manual: version bump and changelog assembly happen at release time, maintainer-only.
