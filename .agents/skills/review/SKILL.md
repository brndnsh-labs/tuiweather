name: review
description: Review the current uncommitted tuiweather diff. Inspects git status + diff --stat to route reviewers — an inline correctness pass for any non-trivial change, plus `/security-review` whenever the diff touches an always-brake surface (user-config schema & migrations, secrets handling, release/publish plumbing, anything destructive or irreversible), and optionally a second-model angle on a meaty diff. Presents the reviewer plan before running. Does NOT change Status — review happens within status:in-progress. Use after /implement, before /done.

# /review — review the uncommitted tree

Goal: pick the right reviewers for what changed, run them, present consolidated findings.

**Shared rules in `.agents/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** This skill is
the detailed expansion of §3 (Reviewers) and routes on §5's always-brake surfaces. The routing
table below is review's own, more-specific version of §3. **Review does not change Status** — the
story stays `status:in-progress` through review and patch.

## Workflow

1. **Choose the review mode.** Use the normal full review unless this invocation immediately
   follows `/patch` and both the original consolidated findings and `/patch`'s outcome table are in
   context. In that case use **finding-closure mode** below. Missing original context is not a
   reason to guess: run the normal full review.
2. **Check for a fast-path receipt** (§5). In normal mode, if `/implement`'s
   `## Verification receipt` is in
   context, recompute its diff fingerprint over the same file list. A match (and every gate in it
   still PASS) means the issue read and the file list already stand proven — skip straight to step
   4's routing with that instead of re-surveying. A stale fingerprint or no receipt: proceed
   normally below, without comment.
3. **Survey the diff.** `git status` + `git diff --stat`. In finding-closure mode, also identify the
   direct patch delta and the files declared in `/patch`'s plan/report. If the diff is empty, say so
   and stop.
4. **Route reviewers.** In normal mode, rows are **additive** — union the reviewers and run each
   once.

   | If the diff touches... | Run |
   | :- | :- |
   | Any non-trivial code change | the **inline correctness pass** — the orchestrator reviews the diff itself, across the angles a heavyweight reviewer would cover (logic, edges, error paths, contracts, invariants). Match depth to risk. Tests **alongside** prod code stay supporting cast — review the behavior change; the prod diff is the subject. |
   | **user-config schema & migrations** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **secrets handling** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **release/publish plumbing** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | **anything destructive or irreversible** | **`/security-review`** *in addition* — non-optional here (§5). Reason about this flow's specific threat model, not just generic categories. |
   | A **test-only** diff | the **test-quality lens** (below) — the tests *are* the deliverable. |
   | A meaty diff built by the default model | optionally a **second-model angle** (below). |
   | Docs only (`*.md`) and/or config, no application code | the **editorial lens** (below) — never "skipping review." |

   **`/code-review` is human-triggered, not a loop step.** The heavyweight multi-angle cloud review
   exists, but only Brandon can invoke it — no skill can run it, and a routing table that
   names it as the baseline just teaches the loop to skip that row. The loop's baseline is the
   inline pass + the second-model angle; when a diff is large or risky enough to deserve the
   heavyweight pass, *say so* in the findings ("worth a human `/code-review`") and leave the call
   to Brandon.

# Review routing

No reviewer agents exist yet — this table is the backlog. Until they're written, `/review` falls back to the general reviewer checking AGENTS.md hard rules.

| Path glob | Reviewer agent | Responsible for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/providers/**`, `test/providers/**` | provider-boundary (missing) | WMO codes and Open-Meteo response shapes never leak past `openmeteo/`; zod schemas match recorded fixtures; naive-local ISO strings become absolute instants exactly once, in normalize |
| `src/lib/weather/**`, `test/weather/**` | domain (missing) | metric-only storage/compute; display conversion only in `format.ts`; time series indexed by UTC instants + `utc_offset_seconds`; preceding-interval precipitation shift honored in `derive.ts` nowcast rules |
| `src/lib/config/**`, `test/config/**` | config (missing) | zod schema discipline; atomic tmp+rename writes; every `schema_version` bump ships a migration |
| `src/app/**`, `src/features/**`, `src/components/**`, `src/theme/**`, `src/viewport/**`, `test/ui/**`, `test/app/**`, `test/components/**`, `test/features/**` | TUI (missing) | breakpoint floors lg ≥96 / md 68–95 / sm 48–67 / xs 32–47 with clamp+ellipsis below 32; single-cell glyphs, no variation selectors or emoji presentation; ~100ms resize debounce kept; single-line strings narrower than their box |
| any `test/**` | test-fidelity (missing) | fixtures instead of network; injected fakes over real waits; golden diffs intentional |

Fallback: paths matching nothing get general review against the AGENTS.md hard rules.

   ### Second-model angle (cheap, orthogonal)

   A reviewer with a **different model than the implementer** shares fewer blind spots — a
   different prior catches what same-model review lets slide. Spawn a reviewer on the other tier
   for a meaty diff, alongside the inline pass. Prompt it for correctness bugs *and* anything that
   "feels off" — the different weighting is the point, so don't over-constrain it. It's cheap; run
   it freely on a substantial diff.

   ### Test-quality lens

   When the tests *are* the deliverable, review them as the subject, not as supporting cast:
   - **Coverage gaps** — which behaviors of the unit under test are still unasserted?
   - **Intent vs implementation** — does the test assert the *contract*, or merely restate what the
     code currently does? The second kind passes forever and catches nothing.
   - **Vacuous asserts** — assertions that cannot fail (a tautology, a threshold below the
     no-op baseline, an assert on a value the test itself just set).
   - **Brittle verbatim** — snapshots and exact-string matches that will break on an unrelated
     change and teach everyone to re-bless them without reading.
   - If a test appears to **codify a bug** — the behavior is wrong but the test enshrines it —
     **flag it as a finding**; never bless it because it passes.

   ### Editorial lens

   A docs/config-only diff gets read as an editor, not a code reviewer — light, but never skipped:
   - **Issue fidelity** — does the change actually satisfy the issue's `Acceptance:` line?
   - **Contradictory wording** — does it conflict with something else this doc/config already says?
   - **References** — do the section numbers, file paths, and links it points at still resolve?
   - **Formatting** — table alignment, heading levels, list markers consistent with the rest of the
     file?
   - **Unintended edits** — anything touched outside what `Touches:` (or the diff itself) named?

   No specialized reviewer, no automatic gate rerun — this lens is deliberately light because §4's
   gates already proved the deterministic part.

   ### Finding-closure mode

   This is a narrow independent check, not `/patch` grading its own work and not an automatic second
   full review:
   - Re-read every original finding by its stable ID (`F1`, `F2`, …) and `/patch`'s claimed outcome.
   - Verify each `fixed` claim against the current code and inspect the direct patch delta for a
     nearby regression. Confirm each `escalated` claim has the explicit disposition §5 requires;
     `remaining` is not clean.
   - Re-run the specific specialized reviewer that originated a finding when its repair remains in
     that reviewer's lane. The orchestrator performs the inline closure check for all other findings.
   - A declared test, fixture, shared type, or generated companion that is directly required by the
     finding remains eligible for targeted closure. An undeclared file, broader behavior change,
     missing original context, or newly discovered finding ends targeted closure and triggers the
     normal full review over the current diff.

5. **Present the plan** (a status update, not a gate — §5):

   ```
   ## Review plan
   **Mode:** normal full review | finding closure
   **Diff:** <N files, +<n>/-<m>>
   **Files:** <key files + scope>
   **Reviewers:** <those firing> — <why each>
   ```

6. **Run them immediately** in the same turn — no "Run them?" wait.
7. **Present the result.** In normal mode, assign every actionable finding a stable in-context ID
   (`F1`, `F2`, …) and include severity (P0/P1/P2) + `file:line` + a **verbatim quote** of the
   offending line. In finding-closure mode, report every original ID as `fixed`, `remaining`, or
   `escalated`, plus any new finding. Then give the matching recommendation:

   ```
   ### Recommendation
   - ✅ Clean → /done
   - ✅ Closure clean → /done
   - ⚠️ Mechanical findings → /patch, then /review in finding-closure mode
   - ❌ Design-level findings → /implement #<n> with a fix-focused prompt
   - 🔄 Closure scope expanded or found a new issue → normal full /review
   - 🛑 A finding contradicts a project memory note → memory wins by default; surface it
   ```

8. **Suggest the next step** from the recommendation.

## Safety

- **A finding is a hypothesis with a citation, not a fact.** Before reporting one, read the cited
  line — grep the *assignment*, not just a textual match. Roughly one in three "X exists at line N"
  claims is a misread, and a confidently wrong finding costs more than a missed one.
- **Empty findings is a valid clean result; *missing* findings is a failure.** If a reviewer times
  out or errors, report that — never fabricate "clean" from an absent answer.

## Edge cases

- **Empty diff:** report; suggest `/next`. Don't run reviewers.
- **Fast-path receipt present but stale or missing a PASS** (§5): treat it as absent — survey and
  route normally, without flagging the mismatch as a finding.
- **Finding-closure context is missing:** run the normal full review; never reconstruct IDs or
  outcomes from memory.
- **Diff mixes story work + unrelated drift:** flag the drift; ask whether to revert before
  reviewing.
- **Finding contradicts a memory note** (an architecture rule, an invariant): the memory wins
  unless Brandon overrides; surface it prominently rather than silently dropping either one.
