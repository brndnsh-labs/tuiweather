# /deploy-prod — ship to production

Goal: make the safe path automatic — **not** the decision to ship.

**Shared rules in `.claude/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** This is the
one skill with a hard human gate. `/burndown`, `/cycle` and every unattended path are forbidden
from invoking it.

# Deploy

Environments: the **npm registry** (prod) and **GitHub Releases** (artifacts). There is no staging.

Sequence (maintainer-only, from clean synced `main`):

1. `./scripts/release.sh <major|minor|patch>` — verifies the tree, runs release gates, bumps `package.json`, prepends a changelog section generated from conventional commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, atomically pushes commit + tag.
2. The `release` workflow prepares exact artifacts and publishes to npm through OIDC trusted publishing (no long-lived token involved).
3. Binaries + checksums are attached to the GitHub release.

Verification: `gh release view vX.Y.Z`, `npm view tuiweather version` shows the new version. Deep details in [docs/RELEASING.md](../../docs/RELEASING.md).

Rollback: npm's unpublish window is short — treat publish as irreversible. Fix forward with a patch release; never re-tag a version.

Agents decline `/deploy-prod` here and hand off to Brandon.

## 1. Preflight (read-only)

- **Clean tree, on `main`, pushed.** A dirty or unpushed tree means the thing you're about to ship
  isn't the thing in the repo. Refuse.
- **Gates green** (§4).
- **Show exactly what's shipping.** Diff against what's *live*, not against the last tag or a
  stored ref — a stored deploy ref drifts silently and will happily lie to you. Read the live
  revision from the running origin and `git log <live>..HEAD`.
- **Any data migration in the pending set → surface it before the gate**, with what it does and
  whether it's reversible. A migration is a §5 always-brake surface in its own right.

## 2. THE GATE

Present the preflight and **stop.** Wait for one explicit "go" from Brandon in this turn.

Not a go: general enthusiasm, approval of the *code*, a merged PR, or an earlier "ship it" about
something else. Approval of the work is not approval of the deploy. If you're unsure whether you
have a go, you don't.

## 3. Deploy

**`deploy.prod` is not set in `.cycle/config.jsonc`** — stop and say so.
There is no deploy command to run, and prod is the last place to improvise one.

## Why this one is gated

Everything else in this pipeline is auto-merged on green because a wrong merge is cheap to walk
back. Prod is different: it's the one place where a mistake is visible to real users on someone
else's schedule. The gate isn't distrust of the pipeline — it's an acknowledgment that the *cost
function* changes here, and the person who owns the consequences should be the one who says go.

## Edge cases

- **Preflight fails:** stop, report which check. Never "deploy anyway."
- **Asked to deploy unattended** (from `/burndown`, an overnight lane, or a chained skill):
  **refuse.** Report that prod needs an explicit invocation.
